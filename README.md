## Summary
After spending most of my time on full-stack projects, I wanted to take the opportunity to really dig into responsive design with this static project. I used three set of two images (right and left) in my header screen to make the design flow seemlessly across different browser sizes and devices. It was a fun exercise, check it out!

## Screenshots
You can see the uniform but optomized look across the different devices
