                            <p>
                                I'm a full-stack javascript developer, meaning that I can't make up my mind. 
                                I love visual design and am giddy if I can seamlessly blend interactive and static elements.
                                When I learned about React components and Redux form validation, I did a little happy dance. 
                                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I also enjoy the challenge of dissecting a third-party API, writing a tricky unit test and implementing RESTful APIs. 
                                I geek out over databases and finding the best way to store information.
                                    
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In my pre-coding life, I freelanced as a photographer and I still love getting out my camera and exporing light and color in the non-virtual world. I
                                relax by making things with my hands and listening to audiobooks.

                        <p>
                            I just spent a couple of days at Startup Weekend Las Vegas where I was part of the winning team! My team was amazing: the idea was fantastic and we 
                            had a wide range of skills, including business, marketing, graphic design and even film-making. I was the sole developer. This is the prototype
                            that I built in about a day and a half, using basic front-end technologies.

                            I needed a way for my kids to manage their money that was as awesome as the budgeting software that I personally use. 
                            I utilized its public API to allow me to add funds on my end while they can get granular with their savings goals on theirs.

                                There are a lot of great sites for sharing and reading reviews. 
                                But what if you are looking for something new and have no idea where to start? 
                                Wouldnâ€™t it be great to read the highest-rated reviews for an area, 
                                rather than having to search for a business first? 
                                Something New combines data from CityGrid and Google maps to let you do just that.

                            <p>
                                    Sometimes it feels like we spend most of our family get-togethers 
                                    in a hotel room trying to decide what to do next. 
                                    Family Reunion was born from a desire for a large group of people to easily decide who wants to do what. 
                                    One participant posts an activity and others can join in or discuss.
