                            <p>
                                I'm a full-stack javascript developer.
                                And when I say "full-stack," I really mean is that I can't make up my mind. 
                                I love visual design and am giddy if I can seamlessly blend interactive and static elements.
                                When I learned about React components and Redux form validation, I did a little happy dance. 
                                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I also enjoy the challenge of dissecting a third-party API, writing a tricky unit test and implementing RESTful APIs. 
                                I geek out over databases and finding the best way to store information.
                                    
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In my pre-coding life, I freelanced at a photographer and I still love getting out my camera and exporing light and color in the non-virtual world. I
                                relax by making things with my hands and listening to audiobooks.

                            I needed a way for my kids to manage their money that was as awesome as the budgeting software that I personally use. 
                            I utilized its public API to allow me to add funds on my end while they can get granular with their savings goals on theirs.

                                There are a lot of great sites for sharing and reading reviews. 
                                But what if you are looking for something new and have no idea where to start? 
                                Wouldnâ€™t it be great to read the highest-rated reviews for an area, 
                                rather than having to search for a business first? Something New lets you do just that.

                            <p>
                                    Once upon a time, my very large family gathered at Lake Tahoe to enjoy a beautiful vacation. 
                                    We ended up spending most of our time in a hotel room trying to decide what to do next. 
                                    Family Reunion was born from a desire for a large group of people to easily decide who wants to do what. 
                                    One participant posts an activity and others can join in or discuss.
