                            <p>Coding is the passion I never knew that I was looking for. 
                                I get to build useful things and continue learning forever. 
                                I love finding out about a new technique and knowing just exactly where to put it to make my projects better.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            When I’m not sitting in front of my computer, you can usually find me devouring a podcast or audio book while I get my hands dirty in the real world. 
                            I love to knit, build furniture and explore.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            I needed a way for my kids to manage their money that was as awesome as the budgeting software that I personally use. 
                            I utilized its public API to allow me to add funds on my end while they can get granular with their savings goals on theirs.

                            <p>
                                There are a lot of great sites for sharing and reading reviews. 
                                But what if you are looking for something new and have no idea where to start? 
                                Wouldn’t it be great to read the highest-rated reviews for an area, 
                                rather than having to search for a business first? Something New lets you do just that.

                            <p>
                                    Once upon a time, my very large family gathered at Lake Tahoe to enjoy a beautiful vacation. 
                                    We ended up spending most of our time in a hotel room trying to decide what to do next. 
                                    Family Reunion was born from a desire for a large group of people to easily decide who wants to do what. 
                                    One participant posts an activity and others can join in or discuss.
